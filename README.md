# Eucalypto

Eucalypto is a database that is designed to store and display information
about plants. Plants are grouped into 'spaces' which users create and then
begin adding information about that space to the database. The database can 
be used to maintain a complete species list of a space and record information 
about the specific plants that exist there. Users are able to upload images
of the plants, add and 

It is designed to be flexible and allow users to to record information about 
plants that are indoor, outdoor, in pots or in the ground.  

An instance of a Eucalypto database maintains it's own species list which
the users are able to curate and update. For each plant that exists in a 
space, users are able to record observations such as the dimensions,
health, presence of pest of disease, is the plant flowering, and more
over time. Users can also upload images of the plant and over time a 
visual timeline of the plant's growth can be constructed.

All user interactions with Eucalypto are through the website which
can be hosted anywhere as required.

This document is provided to provide an overview of the Eucalypto project,
what is required to run it and how to get a server up and running. Specific 
information about the project and it's design is included in the docs which 
can be viewed on the wiki page.
